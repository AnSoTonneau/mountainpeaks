# mountainpeaks

This application is a simple web service for storing and retrieving moutain peaks :
* **REST API**: the web services are implemented using FastAPI. See _/main.py_
* **Database model**: the database model and access are performed using ormar and SQLAlchemy. See _/db.py_
* **Database access**: the data is stored in a PostGIS database. A pgAdmin is deployed for database management.


> **Warning**
> The database and geographical bounding box request don't use for now the specific PostGIS functions. Since I don't know PostGIS, I would need more time to use its functionnalities properly


*  **Docker**: the application is built and deployed in docker containers. See _/docker-compose.yml_ file
